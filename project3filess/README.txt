	No group just me Francisco
2:
	The project took me 5 days to complete 
3:
	Before starting I thought that the Binary Search Tree would be the fastest 
4:
	It turned out that the the hash function was the fastest structure. I believe this is true because in the has function you do not have to traverse anything you just have to pass something trough a function and place it in its corresponding location.
5:
	Better for me would be the Avl tree and by better I mean ease of coding. If better is defined as witch structure worked faster it would be the hash structure because it completed the tasks faster than the AVL tree and the BST
6:
	From the test I preformed I came to the conclusion that the AVL structure works faster when the file is shorter in length.
7:
	Having never read the books and by looking at this data I would say that Bacon did not right his book based on Shakespeare. Their are some some words that show up but I would say that those words are conjunctions or words that tie things together. Based on that like I sated earlier I wouldn't say that the books are similar.

	For the benchmark I was measuring the execution time on the data structure, the sorting, and the printing. For this case when I say that one data structure is better I am saying that the mentioned data structures run time is the quickest. For measuring the structures im timing how long they take to execute. This is used because memory usage is not something to worry about much since this is a small program and there is no need to worry about how fast or how efficiently the program accesses the disk. To get the running time I use the java system.currenttimemilli to get time before executing the file and then the same function after it finished running the code.From the results and can say that in this case using the hash structure is the better option for use in this project. My conclusion from doing this project and also keeping in mind project 2, I say that there is no one data structure that is the best to use for every problem.

	This project was a bit complicated for me. I struggled when it came to implementing the hash function. What helped a lot was reading trough the book no the chapters on hashing. One thing I could have done differently is the time I started on this project.
